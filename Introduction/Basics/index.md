# Basics of Play
Before creating your first character or adventure, you should understand a number of basic concepts used in the game. New concepts are presented in bold to make them easy to find, but this section is only an introduction to the basics of play. The complete game rules are defined in later chapters, and the search function will help you find specific rules you need.

## Defining Characters
In D&D, the players take on the role of **player characters (PCs)**, while the Game Master portrays **nonplayer characters (NPCs)** and **monsters**. While PCs and NPCs are both important to the story, they serve very different purposes in the game. PCs are the protagonists, the narrative is about them, while NPCs and monsters are allies, contacts, adversaries, and villains. That said, PCs, NPCs, and monsters share several characteristics.

Characters are defined by attributes, which measure a character's raw potential and are used to calculate most of their other statistics. There are six ability scores in the game. **Strength** represents a character’s physical might, while **Dexterity** represents agility and the ability to avoid danger. **Constitution** indicates a character’s overall health and well-being. **Intelligence** represents raw knowledge and problem-solving ability, while **Wisdom** measures a character’s insight and the ability to evaluate a situation. Finally, **Charisma** indicates charm, persuasiveness, and force of personality. Ability scores for ordinary folk range from as low as 3 to as high as 18, with 10 representing average human capabilities. High-level characters can have ability scores that range as high as 20 or (rarely) more.

An attribute that’s above the average increases your chance of success at tasks related to the ability score, while those below the average decrease your chance. This adjustment is called an **attribute modifier**.

Your player character is also defined by some key choices you make. The first choice is a PC's **species**, representing the character's parents and heritage, such as human, elf, or goblin. Next up is the PC's **background**, which describes their upbringing, from lowly street urchin to wealthy noble. Finally, and most importantly, a PC's **class** defines the majority of their aptitudes and abilities, like a wizard’s command of powerful arcane spells or a druid’s power to transform into a fearsome beast!

In addition to these key choices, player characters also have a number of **talents** — individual abilities selected during character creation and as the character advances. Every talent has a type to denote where its explanation can be found (for example, elf talents can be found in the elf species) and its theme (wizard talents, for example, grant abilities that deal with spells). Finally, characters have **skills** that measure their ability to hide, swim, bargain, and perform other common tasks.

## Creating a Narrative
Characters and their choices create the story of D&D, but how they interact with each other and the world around them is governed by rules. So, while you might decide that your character undertakes an epic journey to overcome terrifying foes and make the world a safer place, your character’s chance of success is determined by their abilities, the choices you make, and the roll of the dice.

The GM determines the premise and background of most adventures, although character histories and personalities certainly play a part. Once a game begins, the players take turns describing what their characters attempt to do, while the GM determines the outcome, with the table working together toward a specific goal. The GM also describes the environment, other characters’ actions, and events. For example, the GM might announce that the characters’ hometown is under attack by marauding trolls. The characters might track the trolls to a nearby swamp, only to discover that the trolls were driven from their swamp by a fearsome dragon! The PCs then have the choice of taking on an entire tribe of trolls, the dragon, or both. Whatever they decide, their success depends on their choices and the die rolls they make during play.

A single narrative, including the setup, plot, and conclusion, is called an **adventure**. A series of adventures creates an even larger narrative, called a **campaign**.
